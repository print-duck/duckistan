You can increase your chances of getting hired by highlighting your relevant experience, skills, education, and achievements, demonstrating your passion and enthusiasm for the job, and showing that you have researched the company and understand what they are looking for. Additionally, having strong interpersonal and communication skills, being a team player, and having a positive attitude can also be attractive qualities to recruiters.
