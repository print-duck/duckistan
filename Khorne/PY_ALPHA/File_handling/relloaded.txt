Programmed to work and not to feel
Not even sure that this is real
Find my voice
Although, it sounds like bits and bytes
My circuitry is filled with mites
Oh, will I find a love
Or a power plug?
Oh, digitally isolated
Oh, creator, please don't leave me waiting
Programmed to work and not to feel
Not even sure that this is real
