##Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance satisfies more than one form of inheritance ie. It may be consists of all types of inheritance that we have done above. It is not wrong if we say Hybrid Inheritance is the combinations of simple, multiple, multilevel and hierarchical inheritance. This type of inheritance is very helpful if we want to use concepts of inheritance without any limitations according to our requirements.

##class PC:

##class Laptop(PC):

##class Mouse(Laptop): 
##	pass

##class Student3(Mouse, Laptop):

# Driver's code

#Note: There is no sequence in Hybrid inheritance that which class will inherit which particular class. You can use it according to your requirements.
